## LSP Playground

A Language Server built for the educational purpose of understanding [WHAT LSP is and HOW it works.]((https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/))

It doesn't do anything special for any particular language, it is focused on helping you understand what your tools do.

This LSP was tested with Neovim, but would likely work inside Neovim.
